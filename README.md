# Basic vim config

This is a basic vimrc that I use on remote servers and such.

It is based heavily off of the basic.vim config created by @amix, see
https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim

Simply copy `vimrc.local` to `~/.vimrc` and add `colors/solarized.vim` to
`~/.vim/colors`.

If you would like to install it globally (on Ubuntu at least), you can copy
`vimrc.local` to `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` and `colors/solarized.vim` to
`/etc/vim/colors/solarized.vim`.
